Anthony Piermarini received his first professional Bachelors of Architecture degree at Cornell University (1997) and post-professional Masters of Architecture II degree at the Harvard Design School (1999). Anthony is a Massachusetts Registered Architect and a recipient of the 2010 National AIA Young Architects Award.
Committed to design excellence, service, quality and delivery of every project, Anthony works closely with clients, guiding through the design process to help realize each project’s goals. Anthony’s approach emerges from a design philosophy that is sensitive to the specific culture and climate in which architecture operates. He seeks to strengthen the interrelationships between design, technology and the environment in which we build.
Anthony also contributes to expanding the understanding of architecture through talks within the local municipalities, professional organizations and academic communities. He is an advocate for making design accessible and potent, as demonstrated in his firm’s participation in the 1% ProBono program. Anthony is also a Co-Founder of BR-A-CE: Building Research–Architecture–Community Exchange, a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization founded by artists and designers to create new community spaces that engage social, economic, and cultural issues facing communities around the world.
In addition to his professional experience, Anthony is currently Lecturer at Northeastern University, a Critic at the Rhode Island School of Design, and Lead Faculty in Representation at Harvard University Career Discovery program.
